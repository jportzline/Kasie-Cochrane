# Whole Brain Paragraph
When I start an art project I set up all the components I need for the task so I can configure the time needed. Once I have an idea of the direction I want to go in, I have to be sure that my vision is obtainable. After that the creative process can start. I may hit obsticals and I will have to reason with myself by making changes to different aspects of the desired piece and work towards a realistic goal.
