  Whole Brain Paragraph
  </h3>
When I start an art project I set up all the components I need for the task so I can configure the time needed. Once I have an idea of the direction I want to go in, I have to be sure that my vision is obtainable. After that the creative process can start. I may hit obsticals and I will have to reason with myself by making changes to different aspects of the desired piece and work towards a realistic goal.

<h3>

<h3>
  Elevator Pitch
  </h3>
Hi, my name is Kasie Cochrane. I am a digital media artist focusing on innovative ways to help people get creative. I feel it is important to bring joy and happiness to others through the process of creating. I want to work on a way to make "getting creative" realistic for all. Do you have any thoughts on that?

<h3>
  Week One Reflection
  </h3>
Throughout the first week of the Digital Media bootcamp I designed a boared game with a group of talented people. I have realized that it is very benificial to have a diverse group of minds working on a project because of the different life experience and new ideas they bring to the table. Being the only female in the group I feel I have somewhat of a responsibility to work even harder and stive to learn and take in as much as I can during the bootcamp. I only hope I can meet my own expectations.

 The duck image is symbolizing myself as I go with the flow of things, unconfidently. I am more or less testing out the waters. The image of the woman has more of a demeanor and purpose. In three years, or so, I hope to be more comfortable with myself and I hope it shows. When it comes to my professionalism, instead of ridding myself of negativity or failure, may I continue to grow though everything I do and build on each experience.
